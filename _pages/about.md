I am currently a master student enrolled in the Fall 2022 semester in the [School of Optics and Photonics](https://opt.bit.edu.cn/) at [Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)](https://www.bit.edu.cn/).

Prior to joining BIT, I pursued my Bachelor's(BS) degree in Measurement and Control Technology and Instrument from the [School of Mechanical, Electronic and Control Engineering](https://mece.bjtu.edu.cn/) at [Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU)](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/).

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yong Song](https://opt.bit.edu.cn/jsdw/jsml/gdyqyjs/f491c35fcedd48548d87063037b5e67c.htm)
